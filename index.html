				<div class="pt-4">
					<p>Riot Games was founded as an indie game developer in <span class="italic underline">2006</span> by Brandon <span class="text-red-500">"Ryze"</span> Beck and Marc <span class="text-red-500">"Tryndamere"</span> Merrill in Los Angeles.
					<br/> The company announced its only game, "League of Legends: Clash of Fates", in <span class="italic underline">October 2008</span>, and released the game in <span class="italic underline">October 2009</span> as simply "League of Legends".
					<br/> Their game uses a free-to-play model, supported by microtransactions rather than ads or boxed copy sales.</p>
					<p>
					In <span class="italic underline">2008</span>, Riot Games obtained initial funding of US$7 million provided by venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and FirstMark Capital.
					<br/> In a second round of funding in <span class="italic underline">2009</span>, the company raised $8 million from Benchmark, FirstMark, and Chinese technology company Tencent Holdings.
					<br/> In <span class="italic underline">early 2011</span>, Tencent Holdings bought out a majority stake in Riot Games.
					<br/> Tencent later reported the deal was for $231,465,000 in an interim report.
					<br/> On <span class="italic underline">November 8, 2013</span>, Riot Games announced that the company would relocate to a new building in West Los Angeles in 2015.
					<br/> On <span class="italic underline">December 16, 2015</span>, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.
					<br/> On <span class="italic underline">March 8, 2016</span>, Riot announced its acquisition of Radiant Entertainment.
